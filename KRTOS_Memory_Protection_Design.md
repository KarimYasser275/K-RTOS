# KRTOS Memory Protection Design

## 1. Overview and Purpose
Memory protection prevents tasks from accessing unauthorized memory, improving system safety and reliability. Typically implemented using the ARM Cortex-M MPU.

## 2. Requirements
### Functional
- Configure MPU regions per task.
- Enforce access permissions (read/write/execute) for each region.
- Update MPU settings on context switch.
### Non-Functional
- Minimal context switch overhead.
- Robustness against misconfiguration.

## 3. Data Structures and Interfaces
- `MPU_Region_t`: Structure for region base, size, permissions.
- `MPU_Config_t`: Per-task MPU configuration.
- Interfaces:
  - `osKernel_ConfigureMPU(MPU_Region_t* regions, uint8_t count)`
  - `osKernel_ProtectTaskMemory(TCB_config_t* task)`
  - `osKernel_UnprotectTaskMemory(TCB_config_t* task)`

## 4. Dynamic Architecture
- On context switch, load the current task's MPU configuration.
- Fault handler invoked on illegal access.
- Support for static and dynamic region assignment.

## 5. Integration Constraints
- Requires ARM Cortex-M MPU support.
- Must be enabled early in system startup.
- All tasks must have valid region configuration.

## 6. Error Handling
- MPU fault handler must identify and report offending task.
- Return error codes for invalid region setup.

## 7. Example Use Cases
- Isolating user tasks from kernel memory.
- Protecting device driver regions.
- Preventing stack overflows from corrupting other memory.

## 8. Extensibility/Future Enhancements
- Support for dynamic region resizing.
- Per-task region reconfiguration at runtime.
- Integration with debugging and monitoring tools.
