# KRTOS Power Management Design

## 1. Overview and Purpose
Power management enables the system to reduce energy consumption by entering low-power modes and managing wakeup sources, critical for battery-powered and energy-sensitive applications.

## 2. Requirements
### Functional
- Support multiple power modes (active, sleep, stop, standby).
- Allow tasks or the kernel to request power state changes.
- Configure and handle wakeup sources (timers, interrupts).
### Non-Functional
- Minimal wakeup latency.
- Predictable power state transitions.

## 3. Data Structures and Interfaces
- `PowerMode_t`: Enum for power states.
- `PowerManager_t`: Structure for current mode, wakeup sources, callbacks.
- Interfaces:
  - `osKernel_EnterSleepMode(PowerMode_t mode, uint32_t duration)`
  - `osKernel_ConfigureWakeupSource(uint32_t source)`
  - `osKernel_GetPowerMode(PowerMode_t* mode)`

## 4. Dynamic Architecture
- State transitions: active ↔ sleep ↔ stop ↔ standby.
- Wakeup events trigger transition to active mode.
- Callbacks for pre-sleep and post-wakeup actions.

## 5. Integration Constraints
- Must coordinate with scheduler to avoid losing critical events.
- Not all peripherals may support all power modes.
- Wakeup sources must be configured before entering low-power states.

## 6. Error Handling
- Return error codes for invalid mode transitions or configuration.
- Handle failed wakeup or missed events.

## 7. Example Use Cases
- Entering sleep mode during idle periods.
- Using timer or external interrupt as wakeup source.
- Reducing power in sensor-based applications.

## 8. Extensibility/Future Enhancements
- Add dynamic power scaling based on system load.
- Integrate with application-level power policies.
- Support for peripheral-specific power management.
