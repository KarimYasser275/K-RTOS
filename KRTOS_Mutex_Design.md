# KRTOS Mutex Design

## 1. Overview and Purpose
Mutexes provide mutual exclusion for shared resources, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity in concurrent environments.

## 2. Requirements
### Functional
- Allow tasks to lock and unlock a mutex.
- Support blocking and non-blocking lock attempts.
- Support timeout for lock acquisition.
- Support priority inheritance (optional, for future enhancement).
### Non-Functional
- Minimal overhead in lock/unlock operations.
- Deterministic behavior under contention.

## 3. Data Structures and Interfaces
- `Mutex_t`: Structure holding lock state, owner, and waiting queue.
- Interfaces:
  - `osKernel_MutexCreate(Mutex_t* mutex)`
  - `osKernel_MutexLock(Mutex_t* mutex, uint32_t timeout)`
  - `osKernel_MutexUnlock(Mutex_t* mutex)`
  - `osKernel_MutexDelete(Mutex_t* mutex)`

## 4. Dynamic Architecture
- State transitions: Unlocked → Locked (by task) → Unlocked
- Waiting tasks are queued (FIFO or priority-based).
- On unlock, next waiting task (if any) acquires the mutex.

## 5. Integration Constraints
- Must be callable from both thread and interrupt context (with restrictions).
- Mutexes must not be used in ISRs for blocking operations.
- Mutexes must be initialized before use.

## 6. Error Handling
- Return error codes for deadlock, invalid usage, or timeout.
- Detect and handle recursive locking (if not supported).

## 7. Example Use Cases
- Protecting shared peripherals (e.g., UART, I2C).
- Guarding access to shared data structures.

## 8. Extensibility/Future Enhancements
- Add priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion.
- Support recursive mutexes.
- Add statistics for debugging and profiling.
